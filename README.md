# CP-Based-Restaurant-Analysis

The year 2020 brought with it a series of significant changes because of the outbreak of COVID-19. This unexpected pandemic is deeply affecting economic activity around the globe. Moreover, the restaurant industry has been significantly damaged in this unfortunate scenario. Assuming we can summarize the 2020 restaurant industry using the Restaurant Business magazine ranking, we can compare those businesses within the industry and tell how their year was. Some research has sought to study the impact of COVID-19 on the restaurant industry by analyzing firm-level characteristics and stock price reaction. Others have utilized restaurant reviews as a means to help customers and restaurant owners. Nevertheless, as far as we are aware, no study has applied a contrast pattern-based methodology to dig into the restaurant industryâ€™s current situation. Our analysis consists of a series of machine learning methods applied to data from the Restaurant Business magazine rankings. We split up each ranking data into two contrasting groups and then use contrast pattern mining to extract features corresponding to each group. As a result, we count on a set of interpretable patterns and visualizations describing the year 2020 for these sets of restaurants. We hope that these findings can be utilized as guidance for people in this industry.
